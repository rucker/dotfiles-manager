# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

# Assumptions
For the Mac version, a Homebrew installation is assumed.

# TO DO
-Right now, bashrc and bash_profile source other files to handle common elements. A better approach would be to write a script that builds each of these files.
-Script that will set symlinks automatically.
