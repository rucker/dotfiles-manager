# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

## Assumptions
For the Mac version, a Homebrew installation is assumed, as is using GNU Bash.

## TO DO
- Generate template-ish bashrc/bash_profile files for display on GitHub (same as existing files, minues private info).
